A user uploads a picture .

A model or character is shown .

There are different tabs like Tops, Bottoms, Footwear, Dress, Bag — meaning users can customize different parts of the outfit.

Currently, the "Tops" tab is active.

Under Tops, you can see different top options (three cute styles) that the user can select.

There are also "+" and "–" buttons, probably to add or remove items, or maybe zoom or navigate between choices.

It feels very interactive and super us
